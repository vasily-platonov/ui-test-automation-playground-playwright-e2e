## E2E Test Automation

This repository includes a comprehensive **Playwright-based E2E test suite** that covers some UI automation challenges provided by the playground. The test suite implements best practices including the Page Object Model pattern and provides easy-to-use commands for test execution.

### Quick Start for E2E Tests

```bash
# Navigate to e2e directory
cd e2e

# Install dependencies
make install

# Run all tests
make test

# Run core scenarios only
